\title{Reorder identity classes}
\usage{
ReorderIdent(object, feature = "PC1", rev = FALSE, aggregate.fxn = mean,
  reorder.numeric = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Seurat2 object}

\item{feature}{Feature to reorder on. Default is PC1}

\item{rev}{Reverse ordering (default is FALSE)}

\item{aggregate.fxn}{Function to evaluate each identity class based on
(default is mean)}

\item{reorder.numeric}{Rename all identity classes to be increasing numbers
starting from 1 (default is FALSE)}

\item{\dots}{additional arguemnts (i.e. use.imputed=TRUE)}
}
\value{
A seurat2 object where the identity have been re-oredered based on the
average.
}
\description{
Re-assigns the identity classes according to the average expression of a
particular feature (i.e, gene expression, or PC score)
Very useful after clustering, to re-order cells, for example, based on PC
scores
}
\examples{
head(x = pbmc_small@ident)
pbmc_small <- ReorderIdent(object = pbmc_small)
head(x = pbmc_small@ident)
