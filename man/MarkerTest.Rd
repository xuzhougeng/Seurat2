\usage{
MarkerTest(object, cells.1, cells.2, genes.use = NULL, print.bar = TRUE,
  assay.type = "RNA")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Seurat2 object}

\item{cells.1}{Group 1 cells}

\item{cells.2}{Group 2 cells}

\item{genes.use}{Genes to test. Default is to use all genes}

\item{print.bar}{Print a progress bar once expression testing begins (uses
pbapply to do this)}

\item{assay.type}{Type of assay to fetch data for (default is RNA)}
}
\value{
Returns a 'predictive power' (abs(AUC-0.5)) ranked matrix of
putative differentially expressed genes.
}
\description{
Identifies 'markers' of gene expression using ROC analysis. For each gene,
evaluates (using AUC) a classifier built on that gene alone, to classify
between two groups of cells.
}
\details{
An AUC value of 1 means that expression values for this gene alone can
perfectly classify the two groupings (i.e. Each of the cells in cells.1
exhibit a higher level than each of the cells in cells.2). An AUC value of 0
also means there is perfect classification, but in the other direction. A
value of 0.5 implies that the gene has no predictive power to classify the
two groups.

pbmc_small
MarkerTest(pbmc_small, cells.1 = WhichCells(object = pbmc_small, ident = 1),
            cells.2 = WhichCells(object = pbmc_small, ident = 2))
