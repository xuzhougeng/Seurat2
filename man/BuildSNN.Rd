\usage{
BuildSNN(object, genes.use = NULL, reduction.type = "pca",
  dims.use = NULL, k.param = 10, plot.SNN = FALSE, prune.SNN = 1/15,
  print.output = TRUE, distance.matrix = NULL, force.recalc = FALSE,
  filename = NULL, save.SNN = TRUE, nn.eps = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Seurat2 object}

\item{genes.use}{A vector of gene names to use in construction of SNN graph
if building directly based on expression data rather than a dimensionally
reduced representation (i.e. PCs).}

\item{reduction.type}{Name of dimensional reduction technique to use in
construction of SNN graph. (e.g. "pca", "ica")}

\item{dims.use}{A vector of the dimensions to use in construction of the SNN
graph (e.g. To use the first 10 PCs, pass 1:10)}

\item{k.param}{Defines k for the k-nearest neighbor algorithm}

\item{plot.SNN}{Plot the SNN graph}

\item{prune.SNN}{Sets the cutoff for acceptable Jaccard index when
computing the neighborhood overlap for the SNN construction. Any edges with
values less than or equal to this will be set to 0 and removed from the SNN
graph. Essentially sets the strigency of pruning (0 --- no pruning, 1 ---
prune everything).}

\item{print.output}{Whether or not to print output to the console}

\item{distance.matrix}{Build SNN from distance matrix (experimental)}

\item{force.recalc}{Force recalculation of SNN.}

\item{filename}{Write SNN directly to file named here as an edge list
compatible with FindClusters}

\item{save.SNN}{Default behavior is to store the SNN in object@snn. Setting
to FALSE can be used together with a provided filename to only write the SNN
out as an edge file to disk.}

\item{nn.eps}{Error bound when performing nearest neighbor seach using RANN;
default of 0.0 implies exact nearest neighbor search}
}
\value{
Returns the object with object@snn filled
}
\description{
Constructs a Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) Graph for a given dataset. We
first determine the k-nearest neighbors of each cell. We use this knn graph
to construct the SNN graph by calculating the neighborhood overlap
(Jaccard index) between every cell and its k.param nearest neighbors.

\examples{

pbmc_small
# Compute an SNN on the gene expression level
pbmc_small <- BuildSNN(pbmc_small, genes.use = pbmc_small@var.genes)

# More commonly, we build the SNN on a dimensionally reduced form of the data
# such as the first 10 principle components.

pbmc_small <- BuildSNN(pbmc_small, reduction.type = "pca", dims.use = 1:10)
